# Live Game Board Implementation Plan
## External Game State Management for NHL Commentary System

### **Problem Statement**
The current NHL commentary system suffers from catastrophic context collapse when AI session memory becomes corrupted or overwritten. This manifests as:
- Statistical amnesia (shot counts reversing, scores forgetting)
- Phantom players (players appearing on wrong teams)
- Goalie paradoxes (goalies being "perfect" after allowing goals)
- Context overwriting (AI forgetting established game narrative)

### **Solution Architecture: External Game State + Periodic Context Refresh**

The solution treats **AI as a text generator, not a memory system** by maintaining authoritative game state outside of AI sessions and periodically refreshing context to prevent memory corruption.

**Key Insight**: With deterministic state injection, validation becomes largely unnecessary - errors are prevented at the source rather than detected after generation.

---

## **Implementation Status**

**ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Live Game Board architecture implemented and working:

### **âœ… Completed Components:**
- **LiveGameBoard Class** (`src/board/live_game_board.py`): Full state management with roster locks, authoritative scoring, and prompt injection
- **SessionManager** (`src/board/session_manager.py`): Context refresh logic with narrative compaction
- **BasicValidator** (`src/board/basic_validator.py`): Minimal JSON structure validation
- **Pipeline Integration** (`live_commentary_pipeline.py`): Board-integrated pipeline with state injection
- **Working System** (`run_game_commentary.py`): Production-ready NHL commentary with professional audio output

### **ðŸ§ª Test Results:**
- âœ… Successfully processed multiple timestamps with board integration
- âœ… Generated professional WAV audio files (tested: 5 files, ~3MB total)
- âœ… Board state injection working in agent prompts
- âœ… Roster extraction from static context working (40+ players total)
- âœ… Clean repository structure with organized output folders

### **ðŸ”§ Core Prevention Systems Active:**
- **Score Consistency**: Board enforces increasing-only scores
- **Roster Lock**: Only valid players from team rosters can be mentioned
- **Goalie Tracking**: Accurate goals-allowed tracking prevents "perfect" paradoxes
- **State Injection**: Every agent prompt includes authoritative game state

## **Phase 1: Core Live Game Board Implementation**

### **1.1 Create LiveGameBoard Class**

**File**: `src/board/live_game_board.py`

**Requirements**:
```python
class LiveGameBoard:
    """
    Authoritative source of truth for live game state.
    This class maintains all factual game data outside of AI memory.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, game_id: str, static_context: Dict):
        # Game Identity
        self.game_id = game_id
        self.away_team = static_context["away_team"]  # e.g., "EDM"
        self.home_team = static_context["home_team"]  # e.g., "FLA"
        
        # Game State (Authoritative)
        self.current_score = {"away": 0, "home": 0}
        self.current_shots = {"away": 0, "home": 0}
        self.period = 1
        self.time_remaining = "20:00"
        self.game_situation = "even strength"
        
        # Event Tracking
        self.goals = []  # List of goal events with scorer, time, assists
        self.penalties = []  # Active penalties with expiration times
        self.last_goal_scorer = None
        self.last_goal_team = None
        
        # Goalie Performance (Critical for preventing "perfect" paradox)
        self.goalies = {
            "away": {"name": static_context["away_goalie"], "goals_allowed": 0},
            "home": {"name": static_context["home_goalie"], "goals_allowed": 0}
        }
        
        # Roster Lock (ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT)
        self.team_rosters = {
            "away": set(static_context["away_players"]),  # Set for fast lookup
            "home": set(static_context["home_players"])
        }
        
        # Context Management
        self.processed_events = set()  # Prevent duplicate processing
        self.narrative_summary = ""  # Compact version of game story
    
    def update_from_timestamp(self, timestamp_data: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Update board state from timestamp data and return validation report.
        This method is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for state updates.
        """
        
    def validate_player(self, player_name: str, team: str) -> bool:
        """
        Validate if player exists on specified team roster.
        Returns False if player doesn't exist or is on wrong team.
        """
        
    def get_authoritative_state(self) -> Dict:
        """
        Return current game state for injection into AI prompts.
        This becomes the "GAME STATE (AUTHORITATIVE)" section of prompts.
        """
        
    def get_narrative_context(self) -> str:
        """
        Return compact narrative summary of game so far.
        Used for context injection after session refresh.
        IMPLEMENTATION: Start with deterministic template, upgrade to LLM later if needed.
        """
```

### **1.2 Integration Points**

**File**: `live_commentary_pipeline.py`

**Modifications Needed**:

1. **Initialize Game Board**:
```python
# After static context generation
static_context = load_static_context(game_id)
game_board = LiveGameBoard(game_id, static_context)
```

2. **Update Board Before Agent Processing**:
```python
async def process_timestamp_with_all_agents(timestamp_file, data_runner, data_session, commentary_runner, commentary_session, game_board):
    # Load timestamp data
    with open(timestamp_file, 'r') as f:
        timestamp_data = json.load(f)
    
    # UPDATE BOARD FIRST (authoritative state)
    board_update = game_board.update_from_timestamp(timestamp_data)
    
    # Get authoritative state for prompts
    auth_state = game_board.get_authoritative_state()
    
    # Process with data agent (WITH BOARD STATE INJECTION)
    data_result = await process_data_agent_with_board(timestamp_file, data_runner, data_session, auth_state)
```

3. **Inject Authoritative State into Prompts**:
```python
def create_data_agent_prompt_with_board(timestamp_data: Dict, auth_state: Dict) -> str:
    return f"""
GAME STATE (AUTHORITATIVE - DO NOT CONTRADICT):
Score: {auth_state['away_team']} {auth_state['score']['away']} - {auth_state['home_team']} {auth_state['score']['home']}
Shots: {auth_state['away_team']} {auth_state['shots']['away']} - {auth_state['home_team']} {auth_state['shots']['home']}
Period: {auth_state['period']}, Time: {auth_state['time_remaining']}
Last Goal: {auth_state['last_goal'] or 'None'}
Goalies: {auth_state['goalies']['away']['name']} ({auth_state['goalies']['away']['goals_allowed']} GA), {auth_state['goalies']['home']['name']} ({auth_state['goalies']['home']['goals_allowed']} GA)

ROSTER LOCK (ONLY mention players from these lists):
{auth_state['away_team']} Players: {auth_state['rosters']['away']}
{auth_state['home_team']} Players: {auth_state['rosters']['home']}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER contradict the authoritative game state above
2. NEVER mention players not in the roster lock
3. NEVER claim a goalie is "perfect" if they have goals_allowed > 0
4. Build analysis on this factual foundation

TIMESTAMP DATA TO ANALYZE:
{json.dumps(timestamp_data, indent=2)}

Provide your analysis maintaining strict consistency with the authoritative state.
"""
```

---

## **Phase 2: Context Refresh and Compaction**

### **2.1 Session Refresh Strategy**

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Every 10 timestamps (configurable)
- When session context exceeds token limit
- After major game events (period end, multiple goals)
- When validation detects inconsistencies

**Implementation**:
```python
class SessionManager:
    def __init__(self, refresh_interval: int = 10):
        self.refresh_interval = refresh_interval
        self.timestamp_count = 0
        
    async def maybe_refresh_session(self, data_runner, data_session, commentary_runner, commentary_session, game_board):
        self.timestamp_count += 1
        
        if self.timestamp_count % self.refresh_interval == 0:
            # Generate compact narrative summary
            narrative_summary = game_board.get_narrative_context()
            
            # Create new sessions
            new_data_session = await self.create_fresh_data_session(data_runner, game_board, narrative_summary)
            new_commentary_session = await self.create_fresh_commentary_session(commentary_runner, game_board, narrative_summary)
            
            return new_data_session, new_commentary_session
        
        return data_session, commentary_session
```

### **2.2 Narrative Compaction**

**Objective**: Create concise summaries that preserve essential game context without overwhelming token limits.

```python
def generate_narrative_summary(game_board: LiveGameBoard) -> str:
    """
    Generate compact narrative summary for context injection.
    Should be 3-5 sentences maximum.
    """
    summary = f"Game: {game_board.away_team} @ {game_board.home_team}. "
    
    if game_board.goals:
        recent_goals = game_board.goals[-3:]  # Last 3 goals only
        goal_summary = ", ".join([f"{g['scorer']} ({g['team']}) at {g['time']}" for g in recent_goals])
        summary += f"Recent goals: {goal_summary}. "
    
    summary += f"Current score: {game_board.current_score['away']}-{game_board.current_score['home']}. "
    summary += f"Period {game_board.period}, {game_board.time_remaining} remaining."
    
    return summary
```

---

## **Phase 3: Minimal Safety Checks (Optional)**

### **3.1 Basic Output Parsing**

**File**: `src/board/basic_validator.py`

```python
class BasicValidator:
    """
    Minimal validation for technical errors only.
    With deterministic board state injection, content validation is unnecessary.
    """
    
    def validate_json_structure(self, commentary_data: Dict) -> bool:
        """
        Verify JSON structure is correct for downstream processing.
        """
        required_fields = ['commentary_sequence', 'commentary_type']
        return all(field in commentary_data for field in required_fields)
    
    def validate_speaker_format(self, commentary_data: Dict) -> bool:
        """
        Ensure speakers are properly formatted for audio processing.
        """
        valid_speakers = {'Alex Chen', 'Mike Rodriguez'}
        for sequence in commentary_data.get('commentary_sequence', []):
            if sequence.get('speaker') not in valid_speakers:
                return False
        return True
```

**Note**: Content validation (phantom players, score contradictions) is eliminated because deterministic board state injection prevents these errors at the source.
